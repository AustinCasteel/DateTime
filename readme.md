# Date Time - Speechhandler

Naomi can tell you the Date, the local time as well as time somewhere else in the world, and when a holiday is.

Intents:

- What Time is it?
- What Time is it in "LOCATION"?
- What is the Date?
- Tell me the Day of the Week.
- What Day is "HOLIDAY"?
- When is "HOLIDAY"?
